# Proxies

### Adding Proxies

Here the user enter and test his proxies that SEO Neo uses on campaigns.

This menu can be found:

1\) Go to **Settings** (main side menu)

2\) Click on "**Proxies**" tab

First you need to enable "**Use Proxies**" checkbox option.

The user can add his proxies inside the text box. Proxies must be added one per line.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
It is wise for the user to check his proxies before saving or using them on a campaign.
{% endhint %}

### Proxies Format

Proxies usually come in two different formats:

1. \[proxy\_ip]:\[proxy\_port]
2. \[proxy\_ip]:\[proxy\_port]:\[username]:\[password]

{% hint style="warning" %}
For **Oxylabs proxies** the format is as follows:\
\
**\[proxy\_host]:\[proxy\_port]**\
\
**OR**\
\
**\[proxy\_host]:\[proxy\_port]:\[username]:\[password]**
{% endhint %}

SEO Neo supports both types. Just keep in mind to use the correct format (using colon symbol) and enter one proxy per line.

### Testing Proxies

To check user proxies, click on "**Test Proxies**" button and let SEO Neo test if proxies are working.

When using "**Test Proxies**", SEO Neo will ask you if you want non-working proxies to get removed after testing. Select "Yes" if you want non working-proxies to be removed after test.

### Recommended Proxies

Using good quality proxies is very important to achieve high success rates on your campaigns. Proxy speed **is recommended to be more than 3 Mbp\s** (especially when campaign runs heavy-content websites like Web 2.0).

{% hint style="info" %}
We **recommend** using [**ISP Proxies from Oxylabs.**](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=7\&aff_id=1400\&url_id=140)
{% endhint %}

Another thing to consider when choosing proxies, is to use proxies that are as close as possible to your region - either your computer or your server (wherever you are using SEO Neo).

When using rotating mobile proxies, you need to have "**automatic IP reset**" disabled. Most rotating mobile proxy providers, have this option enabled by default, so you need to disabled it, before using them on your campaigns.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have "**automatic IP reset**" disabled, you need to reset your proxies manually. It is recommended to reset your proxy IP every time you run a campaign in order to get new fresh IPs.
